# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context

## Project Overview

**MIZ OKI 3.5** is a Verifiable Autonomous Decision Intelligence Platform. This repository contains the marketing website deployed on Google Cloud Run.

## Positioning & Messaging (CANONICAL — read before touching copy)

The metaphor is a **nervous system**, never a "brain." MIZOKI3 gives a business a
real-time, mathematical understanding of *every* part of itself — a living graph of
metrics, relationships, and **prediction**. It senses the whole organization at once
and acts the moment something changes. It **replaces the CRM and the linear,
backwards-looking analytics stack** (which only record what already happened) with a
forward-looking, predictive system.

**Say:** nervous system · real-time understanding · living/mathematical graph of
metrics and prediction · senses across the whole organization · adapts to your
business · replaces the CRM and backwards-looking dashboards · reflex arc (for SRPVDAL).

**Never say:** "brain," "one brain," "the brain of your business." No "Living Brain"
visualizer.

**Divisions are NOT the product.** The system is unlimited and adaptive — it grows a
decision controller for whatever domains a business actually has (3, 40, or entirely
its own). The five lenses (Counsel / Estate / Capital / Signal / Risk) are **only the
structures of customers we've onboarded so far** — they are *example deployments*, not
a fixed offering or a list to fit into. Always frame them as examples; never imply the
platform ships as five departments.

Canonical hero line: **"A nervous system for your business."**

## Architecture

- **Deployment**: Docker container on Google Cloud Run
- **Web Server**: Python Flask application served via Gunicorn
- **Domain**: mizoki3.com (Cloud Run custom domain)
- **Routing**: Client and API routes managed natively in Flask (`app.py`)

## Core Technology (7-Stage SRDPV-DAL Pipeline)

```
SENSE → REASON → PLAN → VALIDATE → DECIDE → ACT → LEARN
```

Key innovations:
- Decision Control Plane (DCP)
- Validation & Arbitration Layer
- Counterfactual Simulation Engine
- Temporal-Causal Knowledge Graph (TCO-KG)

## Recent Work (June 2026)

### Canonical JourneyEvent Schema — Multi-Connector SENSE Normalization (2026-06-24)

Added a **canonical `JourneyEvent` ingestion layer** so events from **Meta (Conversions
API/Webhooks), Google Ads (GAQL rows), SendGrid (Event Webhook/Inbound Parse), and OpenRTB
(bid request/win/loss)** all normalize into **one schema** and enter SRPVDAL at the **SENSE**
stage deterministically and idempotently. Built in the same deterministic, in-process,
dependency-free style as Cell 27 (no external services, no new pip deps — fully unit-testable).

**Founder supplied two reference designs.** The first was the rich multi-connector
`JourneyEvent` (`event_source`/`event_type`/`actor`/`context`/`provenance`); the second was a
thinner Gemini-extraction shape plus a cURL/Node/Python flow (pin model + API revision, strict
`response_format` json_schema, capture provenance, hash the schema, idempotent upsert by
`event_id`). **Reconciliation:** the multi-connector shape is canonical (it's the only one that
can carry `campaign_id`/`auction_id`/`bidfloor`/`search_term`/`message_id`, which is the whole
point). The two **agree on the mechanics**, so those are first-class: `provenance` carries
`model_version` · `request_id` · `prompt_hash` · `response_schema_hash` · `connector_version`,
and the normalizer accepts optional `model_version`/`prompt`/`request_id` overrides so an
**LLM strict-schema path (Gemini, pinned model)** and the rule-based connectors produce
**audit-identical rows under one schema**.

**New files:**
- `schemas/journey-event.json` — canonical schema (draft 2020-12). Refined the founder draft to
  be self-consistent: added top-level `source_payload_hash` (matches the documented hashing note
  + the BQ table column; the draft had `additionalProperties:false` but omitted it). Served live
  at **`GET /schemas/journey-event.json`** (`application/schema+json`) so it's a real `$ref`
  target for a Gemini `response_format`.
- `mizoki_runtime/journey.py` — deterministic per-source mappers, a **dependency-free JSON Schema
  validator** (type unions/enum/required/properties/additionalProperties; `format` is annotation-
  only per spec), `JourneyEventNormalizer`, an **idempotent JSONL `JourneyEventStore`**, and the
  SENSE-stage `JourneyIngestCell` (normalize → validate gate → upsert → fan-out to the
  `event_store`/`knowledge_graph`/`bigquery`/`audit_log` sinks).
- `mizoki_runtime/journey_sinks.py` + `schemas/journey-event.bigquery.sql` — **optional** external
  upsert sinks (the founder's second-prompt Firestore/BigQuery flow). `FirestoreJourneySink`
  (doc per `event_id`) and `BigQueryJourneySink` (idempotent `MERGE` on `event_id`) **lazily import**
  `google-cloud-firestore`/`google-cloud-bigquery` only inside the upsert path — nothing added to
  `requirements.txt`, default deploy stays dependency-free. The cell delegates inserted/updated
  events (duplicates are skipped to keep replays no-ops) and **degrades gracefully**: a missing
  client lib or credential records a per-sink `error` instead of failing the SENSE batch. Wired
  via env: `MIZOKI_JOURNEY_FIRESTORE_COLLECTION` / `MIZOKI_JOURNEY_BIGQUERY_TABLE` (unset → in-process
  JSONL only). The MERGE SQL + event→row projection are pure functions, unit-testable without the cloud.
- `mizoki_runtime/journey_gemini.py` — **optional** Gemini strict-schema extraction connector (the
  second-prompt LLM path). Calls Gemini with a **pinned model + API revision** and the served
  `journey-event.json` as a strict `response_format` json_schema, then threads the model provenance
  (`model_version`/`request_id`/`prompt_hash`/`response_schema_hash`) through the normalizer's
  `assemble_from_extraction` so an LLM-extracted row is **shape-identical** to the rule-based
  connectors. HTTP uses **stdlib `urllib`** (no new dep) and only fires when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set;
  a `transport` callable is injectable so the parse → provenance → canonicalize path is unit-tested
  with no network. Model/revision pinned via `MIZOKI_GEMINI_MODEL` / `MIZOKI_GEMINI_API_REVISION`;
  `discover().journey.llm_extractor` reports the pin + whether it's configured.

**Idempotency (matches the documented recipe):** `event_id = sha256(event_source || event_type ||
stable_keys_from_source)` — **never** over volatile timestamps; `source_payload_hash =
sha256(canonical_compact_json(payload))`. Store upsert: first sight → `inserted`; same id + same
payload hash → `duplicate` (no write, replays are no-ops); same id + changed payload → `updated`.

**Wiring (`runtime.py`, `app.py`):** MCP tools `journey.normalize_event`, `journey.ingest_events`,
`journey.recent_events` (new `journey` category, discoverable via `/api/mcp/tools` +
`/api/boss/discover`). Flask: `POST /api/boss/journey/normalize`, `POST /api/boss/journey/ingest`,
`GET /api/boss/journey/events`, plus the schema route. KG grounding: new entities
`journey_event` (schema) and `journey_ingest` (cell) wired into `sense`/`srpvdal`/
`validation_arbitration` and to `openrtb_bidstream`. `discover()` gains a `journey` block;
`health_snapshot()` adds `journey_event_count`.

**Verification:** `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/journey.py mizoki_runtime/journey_sinks.py
mizoki_runtime/journey_gemini.py mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py` clean; `python3 -m unittest
tests.test_app tests.test_runtime` → **50 passing** (added 18: 14 runtime — per-connector
normalization + schema validity, pinned provenance + schema-hash, stable `event_id` + idempotent
replay, sink fan-out + persistence, validation-gate rejection, bad-source/payload guards,
external-sink forwarding + duplicate-skip, graceful sink-error degradation, Firestore upsert via
fake client, BigQuery MERGE SQL + row projection, env sink builder, Gemini extractor provenance
threading + strict-schema request via fake transport, Gemini creds-required guard, extractor
metadata; 4 app — schema served, normalize endpoint, idempotent ingest endpoint, event-array
validation). Smoked `app.test_client()`: schema route 200 `application/schema+json`,
`/api/health` carries `journey_event_count`, `/api/boss/discover` carries `journey`, MCP
`journey.ingest_events` returns `{inserted:1}` then `{duplicate:1}` on replay, and Gemini-style
provenance (`model_version=gemini-…`, custom `request_id`) threads through with a matching
`response_schema_hash`. Run traces persist to `data/journey_events.jsonl` (already covered by the
`data/*.jsonl` gitignore rule). No homepage/site copy touched; positioning untouched.

### Homepage §03 ARCHITECTURE — Interactive SRPVDAL Spiral + Subsystem Ownership (2026-06-19)

Integrated a founder-supplied investor slide (the "SRPVDAL spiral" — SENSE → REASON → PLAN →
VALIDATE → DECIDE → ACT → LEARN with three component callouts) into the homepage as a real,
interactive section rather than a static export. Built in the canonical single-file vanilla-JS
`index.html` (no build step), matching the existing exhibit pattern (SVG generated in JS like the
§02 reflex arc and §05 divisions).

**New section `#architecture` (§03 ARCHITECTURE), inserted between §02 reflex arc and the control
plane.** Renders an SVG **spiral** of the seven SRPVDAL stages (outer SENSE spiraling inward to
LEARN, with a center `↻ LOOP TIGHTENS` glyph to convey the continuous, compounding loop) and maps
each stage to the subsystem that owns it:

- **Knowledge Graph** (Temporal-Causal Knowledge Graph) → owns **Reason · Plan** — teal.
- **Financial Model** (Counterfactual Simulation Engine) → owns **Validate · Decide** — amber.
- **Orchestrator** (Boss Agent) → owns **Act · Learn** — green.
- **Sense** is the neutral entry node (where signals enter), unowned by the three — faithful to the
  slide.

**Interaction:** hovering/clicking a legend chip or a stage node isolates that subsystem (colors its
arc + the two stages it owns, dims the rest) and updates a detail panel describing its role; the
center glyph (or clicking an active chip) resets to an overview. Keyboard path is the three `<button>`
legend chips; the SVG nodes are mouse/hover enhancement. Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` (it's
interactive, not animated). Wrapped in try/catch — if it ever throws, the section hides itself rather
than showing an empty card.

**Positioning honored:** nervous-system framing, no "brain" metaphor; subsystems named in
site-consistent vocabulary (TCKG / Counterfactual Simulation Engine), with the founder's exact
callout labels (Knowledge Graph / Financial Model / Boss Agent) surfaced as the subsystem names.
Divisions framing untouched.

**Renumbering (folios are sequential ledger numbers):** new section is §03; CONTROL PLANE §03→§04,
DOMAINS §04→§05, ASSURANCE §05→§06, final filing §06→§07. Nav gained `§03 LOOP` (→`#architecture`)
and bumped CONTROL→§04 / DOMAINS→§05. Anchor hrefs (`#pipeline`, `#control`, `#divisions`) unchanged.

**Files:** `index.html` only — added spiral CSS (`.spiral`/`.sp-*`), the section markup, and one
`SRPVDAL spiral` IIFE (SVG built with `createElementNS`). No `app.py`, runtime, route, or test
changes.

**Verification:** `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py` clean; `python3 -m
unittest tests.test_app tests.test_runtime` → **32 passing**; `node --check` on the extracted
homepage script clean; HTMLParser structural balance passes (no unclosed/stray tags); `app.test_client()`
smoke of `/` → 200 with all new markers (`id="architecture"`, `id="sp-svg"`, `WHO OWNS EACH STAGE`,
`§03 LOOP`, renumbered folios §04–§07) and no `§03 CONTROL` nav regression; all 7 spiral node + label
coordinates confirmed within the viewBox (no clipping).

### Homepage Polish — Live-vs-Repo Audit, DEL Gauge Fix, Illustrative Disclaimer (2026-06-18)

Reviewed a founder-supplied `index.html` paste against **live mizoki3.com** and repo
`index.html`. Finding: the paste was **not a full redesign** — production already shipped
the June-13 interactive homepage (executable SRPVDAL sim, hero schema inspector, authorization
scorecard, control-plane sandbox). The paste was a **polish pass** with four meaningful deltas
over live. Repo root `index.html` was already byte-identical to live (1,067 lines / 71,671 bytes)
before this session; an older ~827-line static reflex-arc version must **not** be redeployed —
that would roll back all interactivity.

**Four deltas cherry-picked and shipped (`index.html` only — no `app.py`, runtime, route, or test changes):**

1. **DEL gauge narrative fix (§03).** Live had an internal contradiction: copy cited ACT-991 at
   **39** (vetoed) while the gauge displayed **87** and animated to 87 (eligible). Fixed initial
   HTML to `39` with `var(--veto)` styling, label `DEL SCORE · ACT-991 VETOED`, arc fill
   `439.8*(1-0.39)` with veto stroke, and IntersectionObserver animation counting to 39 (both
   observer and no-JS fallback branches). Aligns gauge with simulation default, scorecard, and
   "ACT-991 at 39" copy. Control-plane **sandbox** left at 82/ELIGIBLE default — intentional;
   it is an independent interactive demo, not tied to ACT-991.
2. **Illustrative figures disclaimer.** Added strip footer under the five metric cells:
   `ILLUSTRATIVE FIGURES · REPRESENTATIVE OF A DEPLOYED MIZOKI3 SYSTEM` — enterprise liability
   hygiene on synthetic stats (48,213 nodes, 1,294 signals/24h, etc.).
3. **Domains copy (§04).** Replaced "how the **customers we've onboarded** happen to be structured
   **today**" with "how a **typical deployment tends to be structured**" — matches canonical
   positioning that divisions are example deployments, not a fixed product shape. Kept footer line
   "Your deployment is whatever your business is. There is no list to fit into."
4. **Hero plate label.** `EXHIBIT A — ORGANIZATIONAL GRAPH · ILLUSTRATIVE` (was missing
   `· ILLUSTRATIVE`). `▸ INSPECT NODES` unchanged.

**Not changed (already correct on live):** executable sim controls and deterministic model
(`post = $6.0M − amount`; breach if `post < floor`; DEL `= 62 + marginPct·1.1 − (amount/pool)·6 −
(legal ? 0 : 45)`; default Capital · $5.0M · floor $2.0M → score 39, VETO, Option B $4.0M);
hero schema inspector (Counsel CLAUSE GRAPH overlay, five `dnode`s + TCKG core); authorization
scorecard (four gates, fiduciary BREACH); sandbox presets; no `/manufacturing` footer link.

**Branch / deploy:** `cursor/homepage-polish-deltas-c454` → **PR #6** squash-merged to `main`
at `13e2061` (*Homepage polish: DEL gauge fix, illustrative disclaimer, domains copy*). WIF
auto-deploy workflow `deploy-cloudrun.yml` run **`27796329844`** built + rolled Cloud Run green
in ~48s.

**Verification before merge:** `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py` clean;
`python3 -m unittest tests.test_app tests.test_runtime` → **32 passing**; `app.test_client()`
smoke of `/` → 200 with markers `sim-run`, `schema-ov`, `ILLUSTRATIVE FIGURES`,
`ACT-991 VETOED`, `typical deployment tends`, `EXECUTABLE CAUSAL SIMULATION`; ACT-991 model
probed (amt 5.0, floor 2.0, post 1.0, score 39, verdict veto, optB 4.0).

**Post-deploy audit (mizoki3.com vs founder reference paste):** repo `index.html` and live HTML
confirmed **byte-identical** after deploy. Full section-by-section audit — 43 content markers PASS
(top bar `DOC. MZK3-2026 · REV 4`, nav §02/§03/§04, hero nervous-system copy, exhibit + schema
inspector, metrics + disclaimer, §02 "Run one yourself" sim, §03 gauge 39 + scorecard + sandbox,
§04 typical-deployment copy, §05 assurance, §06 CTA, footer five example domains only). Regressions
checked: no gauge 87, no "customers we've onboarded" on page, no `IMMUTABLE DECISION TRACE`
header, no `/manufacturing` link, no "brain" product metaphor.

**Gotcha for future agents:** if `index.html` is ~827 lines with a static `STAGES` array and no
`sim-inputs` / `schema-ov` IDs, that is **stale** — fetch live or use current `main` before editing.
Interactive homepage lives entirely in root `index.html` (single-file vanilla JS, no build step).

### Homepage Strategic Upgrades — Executable Simulation + Schema Inspector + Dynamic Gating (2026-06-13)

Turned the homepage (`index.html`) into a **physical demonstration of the system's deterministic
physics** to kill the "is this just a static script / ChatGPT wrapper?" sales friction. Three
interactive upgrades, all built in the canonical single-file vanilla-JS `index.html` (no build
step) — **not** in a React `src/App.jsx`. (The task brief referenced replacing `src/App.jsx`, but
the only `App.jsx` files in this repo live under the untracked scratch `Noah_gemini/` tree and
never deploy; the production homepage that serves on `mizoki3.com` is the Flask static
`index.html`, so the upgrades landed there to actually ship.)

1. **Executable Causal Simulation (§02 reflex arc).** The old auto-playing static ACT-991 trace is
   now an input-driven SRPVDAL state machine. Controls: **transaction amount** ($0.5M–$10.0M),
   **liquidity / fiduciary floor** ($1.0M–$5.0M), **domain cell** (Counsel / Estate / Capital /
   Signal / Risk), and a **legal-compliance toggle** (covenants clear ↔ covenant breach). "RUN
   DIAGNOSTIC SIMULATION" runs a deterministic local model — `post = $6.0M reserve − amount`;
   liquidity breach if `post < floor`; DEL score `= 62 + marginPct·1.1 − (amount/pool)·6 −
   (legal ? 0 : 45)`, clamped 0–100 — then dynamically rebuilds the 7-stage trace + ledger with the
   real numbers and animates it. Hard constraints (legal fail or floor breach) force a VETO
   regardless of score; otherwise ≥80 ELIGIBLE, ≥60 OPERATOR GATE, else VETO. On veto it re-routes
   to a computed **Option B = pool − floor** (the largest transaction that holds the floor). Default
   inputs reproduce ACT-991 (Capital · $5.0M · floor $2.0M · clear → VETO, score 39, Option B $4.0M).
2. **Interactive Graph Schema Inspector (hero).** The hero "EXHIBIT A" graph gained five clickable/
   hoverable domain nodes + a TCKG core. Selecting a node isolates it (dims the rest) and prints its
   Cypher-style relationship schema into a dark inspection overlay — e.g. Capital shows
   `(Reserve)-[:FUNDS]->(Distribution)`, `(Covenant)-[:GOVERNS]->(Reserve)`,
   `(Reserve)-[:EXPOSES]->(Risk.Limit)`. Every domain carries one cross-domain edge (e.g.
   `(Clause)-[:LINKS]->(Capital.Covenant)`) to make the **shared substrate** visible. Core node
   clears the selection.
3. **Dynamic Visual Gating.** Upgrades 1+3 are the same wiring — moving the sliders/toggle reactively
   flips the terminal between VETOED / OPERATOR GATE / ELIGIBLE with matching stamp + state colors,
   so a buyer can physically trigger the DCP veto. All three states are reachable (verified the GATE
   band is not a dead zone). The pre-existing §03 DEL-gauge sandbox (abstract confidence/policy/risk
   sliders) is left untouched as a complementary demo.

**Implementation notes:** new CSS for `.dnode/.dcore/.schema-ov` (hero inspector) and
`.sim-inputs/.sim-dom/.sim-toggle/.sim-run` (sim console) + a `.stamp.gate` amber stamp and
`.tl.gate` trace dot. The old static `STAGES` array / `startPlay` auto-player was replaced by the
sim-engine IIFE; the pipeline IntersectionObserver now fires one auto-run (`runEl._auto`) when the
section scrolls into view instead of looping. Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` (renders final state
without animation). No `app.py`, runtime, route, or test changes.

**Verification:** `python3 -m py_compile` clean; **32 unittest pass**; `node --check` on the extracted
homepage script clean; `app.test_client()` smoke of `/` → 200 with all new IDs/markers present
(`sim-run`, `schema-ov`, `dnode`, domain `data-k`s, "EXECUTABLE CAUSAL SIMULATION", "▸ INSPECT
NODES"); HTMLParser structural balance check passes; model probed in node to confirm
veto/gate/eligible verdicts match intended inputs. Shipped on branch
`claude/mizoki3-strategic-upgrades-s1almy`.

### Decision Ledger Site Deployed to Cloud Run / mizoki3.com (2026-06-12)

Shipped the two pending Decision Ledger commits (the `/4/` sandbox replacement
`d8c1ad1` and the root promotion `3dd848a` — both entries below) to production.
Local `main` was 2 ahead of `origin/main` with nothing dirty besides untracked
junk (`site/`, `files/`, several `mizoki3-complete-site*.zip` — none deploy, all
left alone).

**Process:** re-ran the verification standard (py_compile clean, 32 unittest
pass), pushed `c206d13..3dd848a` to `main` → WIF auto-deploy workflow
(`deploy-cloudrun.yml`, run `27432720438`) built and rolled the new
`mizoki-website` Cloud Run revision green in ~45s.

**Live smoke (mizoki3.com):** all 200 — `/` (title *"MIZOKI3 — A Nervous System
for Your Business"*), the five division directories ± trailing slash, `/blog/`,
`/blog/feed.xml`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/console`, slots `/1` `/3` `/4/`,
`/sitemap.xml`. Unknown paths 404 with the ledger "This page was vetoed." body.
Note: the feed lives at `/blog/feed.xml` only — there is intentionally no root
`/feed.xml` (it 404s).

**Loose ends flagged (not addressed):** (1) GitHub Actions warns the deploy
workflow's actions (`actions/checkout@v4`, `google-github-actions/auth@v2`,
`google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2`) run on Node 20, which GitHub forces to
Node 24 starting **2026-06-16** — bump them in `deploy-cloudrun.yml` soon.
(2) The 28 Dependabot vulnerabilities (6 high) on the default branch remain
outstanding. (3) The untracked zips/`site/`/`files/` clutter remains in the tree.

### "Decision Ledger" Promoted to Site Root — mizoki3.com (2026-06-12)

Immediately after landing in `/4/` (entry below), the founder directed the Decision
Ledger site to run as the **main site**. The pristine un-rewritten `site/` copy (root-
absolute links) was promoted to the repo root: new `index.html` (ledger v3 homepage),
division dossiers as directories (`counsel/`, `estate/`, `capital/`, `signal/`, `risk/`
— old flat `counsel.html` etc. deleted), `privacy/`, `terms/`, `404.html`, robots/
sitemap/favicons/og-image, and the four new blog articles + new `blog/index.html` +
`feed.xml` merged into `blog/` (legacy `relu-lens-meta-algorithm.html` and
`decision-control-plane.html` kept and still routed).

**Flask changes (`app.py`):** division routes serve `<dir>/index.html` via new
`serve_dir_page()`; new `/privacy` + `/terms` routes; `blog_post()` resolves
directory-style slugs before `.html` fallback; 404 handler now serves the ledger
`404.html` ("This page was vetoed."). `/login` intentionally **kept** as the redirect
to the command-center UI (the kit's login shell posts to an unwired `/auth/login`);
the v4 `login/` page was not copied to root. The `/4/` slot remains as the sandbox
duplicate.

**Verification:** py_compile clean, 32 unittest pass, 23-route smoke all PASS
(divisions ± trailing slash, new + legacy blog slugs, policies, feeds, statics,
slots, 404 body, login redirect).

### /4/ Slot Replaced with "Decision Ledger" v4 Sandbox Site (2026-06-12)

Replaced the old `/4/` React slot with the 16-page static "Decision Ledger" site from
`mizoki3-site-v4-sandbox.zip` (unzipped source kept at `site/`, untracked). All
root-absolute internal links (`href="/..."`, og/canonical `https://mizoki3.com/...`,
sitemap/feed/robots URLs) were rewritten to `/4/`-prefixed so the slot is
self-contained — links no longer escape to the main site. The login form's
`action="/auth/login"` was left as-is (backend still unwired, per the kit's DEPLOY.md).

**Flask change:** `app4_asset()` in `app.py` now resolves directory-style pages —
`/4/counsel/`, `/4/blog/<slug>/` serve their own `index.html` before the SPA-style
fallback to the slot root. Other slots (`/1`–`/3`) untouched.

**Verification:** py_compile clean, 32 unittest pass, test_client smoke of 22 routes
(all `/4/` pages + root + `/console` + `/1` + `/3`) all 200 with correct page bodies.

### Diverged-Branch Reconciliation + Cloud Run Deploy (2026-06-12)

Brought local and `origin/main` back in sync and shipped to production. Going in, the
branch had **diverged**: local was 1 commit ahead (`58f7315` *Ship nervous-system
homepage + canonical positioning docs*) and remote was 4 ahead (the Cell 27 work +
the 2026-06-09 homepage-provenance docs). The apparent "two homepages" scare turned out
to be a non-issue.

**Key finding — the homepage was never in conflict.** `index.html` was **byte-identical**
on both sides (same blob SHA `d6f728ae`, 590 lines). The local "homepage rebuild" commit
and the remote one had converged on the same nervous-system `index.html`; the deployed
site already carried it. The only files local `58f7315` uniquely added/changed were
`POSITIONING_AND_MESSAGING.md`, doc edits in `CLAUDE.md`, and a small `app.py`/blog touch.

**Reconciliation method — rebase, not merge:**

- Stashed the dirty working-tree junk (the `mizoki3-final-*.zip` deletions + `Noah_gemini/`
  deletions) into stash `deploy-zip-junk` so only real content rebased. Untracked
  `files/` and `mizoki3-complete-site*.zip` were left alone — none of it deploys.
- `git rebase origin/main`: `app.py` auto-merged clean; the **only conflict was in
  `CLAUDE.md`**, and it was purely additive — HEAD's 2026-06-09 entries (Cell 27 +
  homepage provenance) vs. local's 2026-06-02 messaging-correction entry. Resolved by
  **keeping both**, newest-first. Result landed as `c437821`.

**Verification before push:** `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py` clean;
`python3 -m unittest tests.test_app tests.test_runtime` → **32 passing**.

**Deploy:** pushed `7b12eb9..c437821` to `main` → WIF auto-deploy workflow
(`deploy-cloudrun.yml`, run `27429133149`) built + rolled a new Cloud Run revision green
in ~1 min. Live smoke test 200 on `/`, `/console`, `/blog`, `/1`, `/3`.

**Loose ends flagged (not addressed this session):** stash `deploy-zip-junk` still holds
the zip/`Noah_gemini` deletions; untracked `files/` + `mizoki3-complete-site*.zip` remain
in the tree. GitHub Dependabot reports **28 vulnerabilities (6 high, 18 moderate, 4 low)**
on the default branch — unrelated to this deploy.

### Provenance-Note Deploy + "Docs Deploy but Aren't Served" Verification (2026-06-10)

Landed the 2026-06-09 homepage-provenance addendum (entry below) to `main` and ran the
deploy end-to-end to confirm production actually picked it up.

**Branch handling — used the fresh-branch pattern, not the prescribed
`claude/add-monitoring-dashboard-ENme0`.** That branch, recreated off an older base,
re-added the Cell 27 H3 that already lived on `main`, so **PR #3** went
`mergeable_state: dirty` on a duplicate heading that git couldn't reconcile. Abandoned it:
cut `claude/docs-homepage-provenance-2026-06` from current `main` (`41d52ec`) carrying
**only** the provenance section, opened **PR #4** (clean diff), squash-merged to `main` at
`7b12eb9`, and closed PR #3 as superseded. (This is the `7b12eb9` that the 2026-06-12
Diverged-Branch entry above rebased onto.)

**Deploy confirmed.** The merge to `main` triggered `deploy-cloudrun.yml` (run
`27294723804`): built + pushed `gcr.io/spry-bus-425315-p6/mizoki-website@sha256:1f2244…a5c26`
and rolled Cloud Run revision **`mizoki-website-00066-gzj`** to 100% traffic in ~60s
(17:43→17:44 UTC). Live smoke: `mizoki3.com/` → 200, `last-modified` matched the deploy window.

**Gotcha worth keeping — this is exactly why a docs push can look like "it didn't deploy":**

- The deploy workflow has **no path filter.** *Every* push to `main`, including docs-only
  commits, runs the full Docker build → GCR push → `gcloud run deploy` and produces a new
  Cloud Run revision. (Build context transfers the whole repo — `.dockerignore` is ~2 bytes —
  but Flask still serves from `BASE_DIR`, so this is cost/noise, not a correctness issue.)
- **`CLAUDE.md` and the other dev docs are not served by Flask** — `app.py` has no
  `/CLAUDE.md` route. So a docs-only deploy ships a brand-new revision with **zero
  user-visible change** on `mizoki3.com`.
- **Therefore: don't read "nothing changed on the live site" as "the deploy failed."**
  Verify the real outcome from the `gcloud run deploy` step log (the
  `revision [...] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic` line) or by
  diffing `curl -sI https://mizoki3.com/`'s `last-modified` against the run time — not by
  eyeballing the homepage.

### Cell 27 — Programmatic Intelligence: OpenRTB Bidstream → SRPVDAL Alignment (2026-06-09)

Added a **graph-native programmatic intelligence cell (Cell 27)** so OpenRTB bidstream signals enter the platform at the SENSE stage and flow through the *entire* SRPVDAL spiral instead of being routed straight into decisioning. The **VALIDATE stage is the hard safety gate** — no optimization reaches ACT without clearing it.

**Where it lives:** `mizoki_runtime/runtime.py`, class `ProgrammaticIntelligenceCell` (deterministic, no external services — the bidstream "sinks", DSP/budget APIs, and backtests are modeled in-process so the pipeline is reproducible and unit-testable).

**Per-stage behavior:**
- **SENSE** — `ingest_bidstream()` normalizes loosely OpenRTB-shaped records (requests, win/loss notices, buyer IDs, exchange/seat metadata, floors, currency, consent) into canonical auction/impression events with full provenance, then fans them out to the `bigquery`, `knowledge_graph`, `event_store`, and `audit_log` sinks. Consent is evaluated (GDPR/TCF + US-privacy opt-out).
- **REASON** — per-exchange/seat aggregation (win rate, ROAS, CPM, floor pressure), identity resolution, anomaly detection (`consent_gap`, `spend_no_return`, `low_roas`, `low_win_rate`, `floor_pressure`), opportunities, insights, predictions.
- **PLAN** — candidate action objects (`increase_bid`, `decrease_bid`, `adjust_bid_to_floor`, `suppress_seat/exchange`, `reallocate_budget`, `expand_inventory`, `modify_audience`) each carrying `expected_roas_lift` + `confidence`, plus a `hold` baseline.
- **VALIDATE** — policy checks (budget, brand-safety, consent/legal), KG historical-conflict check, and a simulation/backtest check; every plan labeled `pass` / `escalate` / `fail`. Scaling spend on non-consented supply is a hard `fail`.
- **DECIDE** — ranks validated plans by `expected_roas_lift × confidence` net of risk/cost, selects the top N, emits a reasoning chain + `requires_approval` flag. Defaults to **needs_approval** unless `auto_execute=True` and nothing escalated.
- **ACT** — executes approved low-risk actions against the mapped API surface with a rollback token + provenance record; otherwise holds them `pending_approval`. Audit log always written.
- **LEARN** — measures realized vs. expected lift, emits a reward signal, proposes policy/threshold updates, and feeds KG/agent-memory updates (incl. a recommended skill seed).

**Surfaces:**
- MCP tools: `programmatic.ingest_bidstream`, `programmatic.run_pipeline`, `programmatic.recent_runs` (registered in the `programmatic` category; discoverable via `/api/mcp/tools` and `/api/boss/discover`).
- Flask endpoints: `POST /api/boss/programmatic/ingest`, `POST /api/boss/programmatic/run`, `GET /api/boss/programmatic/runs`.
- KG grounding: new entities `programmatic_intelligence` (Cell 27) and `openrtb_bidstream`, wired into `sense`/`srpvdal`/`decision_control_plane`/`validation_arbitration`.
- Discovery + health: `/api/boss/discover` gains a `programmatic` block (cell id, sinks, tools, recent runs); `health_snapshot()` adds `programmatic_run_count`.
- Policy thresholds are overridable per run via the `constraints` channel (e.g. `"min_roas=2"`, `"target_roas=4"`). Optional `budget` cap drives the VALIDATE budget check. `auto_execute` (default off) and `max_actions` (default 3) bound the ACT stage.

**Repository hygiene:** added `data/*.jsonl` and `data/*.json` to `.gitignore` so the Boss runtime's generated artifacts (decision logs, graph-native loop traces, the new `programmatic_runs.jsonl`, learned skills, tool aliases) no longer pollute `git status` — only `data/.gitkeep` stays tracked. Mirrors the May-2026 bytecode-hygiene precedent.

**Verification:** `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py` and `python3 -m unittest tests.test_runtime tests.test_app` — now **32 passing tests** (added 7: full-pipeline + persistence, safety-gate blocks unsafe scaling, auto-execute approves a scale opportunity, ingest-only SENSE, empty/invalid-event rejection, plus the two API tests). Also smoke-tested the live API path end-to-end via `app.test_client()`: a waste signal produced `spend_no_return` anomalies → suppress plans → validated `pass` → DECIDE `approved` → ACT `executed` with rollback tokens + provenance → LEARN reward signal. Shipped on branch `claude/openrtb-srpvdal-alignment-607lkw` (commit `65c9b62`). Run traces persist to `data/programmatic_runs.jsonl`.

### Homepage Merge — Provenance Note (2026-06-09)

Bookkeeping addendum to the 2026-05-22 "Decision OS Homepage + React Sibling Project" entry below. Records how the rebuilt `index.html` (the commit referenced there as `6c95d5a`) was actually assembled — source material, merge rules, verification — none of which was captured the first time. No functional change to the live site.

**Source material — three competing drafts that fed the merge**:

1. **React/Lucide draft** (≈225 lines, single React component). Cinematic dark background, knowledge-graph blob backdrop, four-quadrant industry section. Built around five SRPVDAL stages, not seven. No interactivity beyond an auto-cycling loop.
2. **Plain-HTML draft** (≈100 lines, single self-contained file). Tight and declarative. Twelve sections: hero with TCKG visualizer + concentric nodes, status-quo vs paradigm, full 7-stage SRPVDAL loop, Decision Control Plane scorecard, replay timeline, media wedge, divisions grid, demo CTA. Zero JS handlers.
3. **Interactive-HTML draft** (≈900 lines, Tailwind CDN + lucide + JetBrains Mono / Inter). Richest of the three: animated TCO-KG hero, clickable 7-stage SRPVDAL inspector with per-stage JSON payload, tabbed domain cells (four — Counsel/Estate/Risk/Media), execution sandbox terminal with three live-trace scenarios.

**Merge rules applied**:

- Took the visual identity, dependency stack (Tailwind CDN + lucide + Inter + JetBrains Mono), and interactivity scaffold from draft 3.
- Took the section roster, hero structural framing, and replay-timeline content from draft 2.
- Took the multi-tier blur backdrop and divisions framing from draft 1.
- **Renamed draft-3 domain cells from four to five** to match this repo's canonical five-division naming (Counsel / Estate / Capital / Signal / Risk). Draft 3 had "Media Acquisition" — collapsed into Signal per the May 18 consolidation. Added a Capital cell that none of the three drafts had.
- Wired all domain links to existing Flask routes (`/counsel`, `/estate`, `/capital`, `/signal`, `/risk`), the live-console pill to `/console`, and the demo CTA to `mailto:hello@mizoki3.com`.
- Stripped any `pilot@mizoki3.com` / `sales@mizoki.com` slip-throughs in favor of the canonical `hello@mizoki3.com`.

**Verification done before the original push**:

- Python `HTMLParser` structural check on the assembled file — stack balanced, no unclosed tags. (`<br />` / `<meta />` raise XHTML-style warnings only; not actual structural errors.)
- Every JS handler (`selectEngineStage`, `selectDomainCell`, `activateSandboxScenario`, `triggerSandboxSimulation`, `resetSandboxTerminal`, `triggerDemoToast`) was traced against the DOM IDs it touches — all targets present.
- Every lucide icon name used (28 distinct: `globe-lock`, `network`, `scale`, `landmark`, `trending-up`, `radio-tower`, `shield-alert`, `shield-check`, `eye`, `brain-circuit`, `git-merge`, `layers`, `zap`, `activity`, `history`, `database`, `clock`, `gauge`, `bar-chart-3`, `rotate-cw`, `file-check`, `terminal`, `rewind`, `play`, `arrow-right`, `info`, `chevron-right`, `x`, `check`) was checked against the lucide.dev catalog.
- No Flask route, runtime, or test file touched. `tests/test_app.py` and `tests/test_runtime.py` unaffected; the 25-test baseline holds.

**Lifecycle of the homepage branch**:

- Original branch `claude/add-monitoring-dashboard-ENme0` first created off `main` at `4efddc2`.
- Commit `6c95d5a` pushed to that branch with the merged `index.html` (88KB / ~1340 lines).
- Branch merged into `main` (post-merge head `487ee4e`) and deleted.
- This bookkeeping addendum lands separately via branch `claude/docs-homepage-provenance-2026-06` cut from `main` at `41d52ec`. A first attempt to re-use `claude/add-monitoring-dashboard-ENme0` (PR #3) hit a structural conflict — the recreated branch predated the Cell 27 entry that landed on main in the interim, and git couldn't reconcile the duplicate H3.

### Messaging Correction + Homepage Rebuild to the Nervous-System Positioning (2026-06-02)

Per direct founder correction, two framing errors that had propagated through the live
site and this file were fixed:

- **"Brain" → "nervous system."** The product is a living nervous system that gives the
  business real-time understanding of every part of itself — a mathematical graph of
  metrics and prediction — and **replaces the CRM and the linear, backwards-looking
  analytics** stack. The old "One brain. Your business." hero and the "Living Brain"
  visualizer language are retired. See the new **Positioning & Messaging** section at the
  top of this file (now canonical).
- **Divisions are example deployments, not the product.** Counsel/Estate/Capital/Signal/
  Risk are only the structures of currently-onboarded customers. The system is unlimited
  and adapts to any business. The homepage divisions section is reframed as
  "Example deployments — current customers," with copy stating there is no list to fit into.

**New `index.html`** (single-file, inline CSS + vanilla JS, no build step — drop-in to the
Flask static server like the rest of the repo):
- Hero: *"A nervous system for your business."* with an animated knowledge-graph canvas.
- Thesis section contrasts the **CRM era (linear, backwards-looking)** vs **a living nervous
  system (real-time, predictive)**.
- Interactive **7-stage SRPVDAL "reflex arc"** that runs the ACT-991 covenant-breach decision
  ($5.0M distribution → liquidity-floor breach → VETOED → safe Option B) with a live immutable trace.
- Animated **DEL eligibility gauge** (87, "Eligible for Autonomous Action").
- **Adaptive divisions** section (five shown as example deployments only) + governance cards
  mapped to the Terraform (CMEK, VPC isolation, HITL, immutable ledger).
- Honors the brand system: Instrument Serif (display) / DM Sans (body) / JetBrains Mono
  (labels), dark-ink palette. Institutional "decision terminal" aesthetic.

**Known drift to reconcile:** the Drive mirror of `index.html` (May-22 "Decision OS" build)
lags the deployed `mizoki3.com`, which had already moved to a cleaner "One brain. Your
business." page. Both are now superseded by this nervous-system rebuild. Deploy path
unchanged: replace `index.html`, run `python3 -m unittest tests.test_app`, then `./deploy.sh`
(or push to `main` for WIF auto-deploy).

## Recent Work (May 2026)

### Slotted React Apps + Sweep of Redundant Files / Services (2026-05-24)

**Four React/Vite siblings mounted under `mizoki3.com/<N>/`** via three commits (`04c0cae`, `a1f9b7d`, `ec57378`) that landed during this session:

- `/1/` — Vite-built React app (ChatGPT, single-page rebuild of the marketing site)
- `/2/` — Vite single-page MIZOKI3 site (Claude, single-page + standalone `console/`)
- `/3/` — Vite multi-page React+Router app (ChatGPT, the differentiated one: Simulator, Engine, Control Plane, Divisions, Governance, KPIs, Blog, Contact pages with `framer-motion` and `KnowledgeGraphBackground`)
- `/4/` — Vite single-page React + `console/` (Claude, branded /4/)

**Shipped architecture** (chose this over per-slot Cloud Run services):
- Each slot is a flat pre-built `<N>/` directory at the repo root, containing `index.html`, `assets/`, and (for /2, /4) `console/`.
- `app.py` has three routes per slot: `/<N>`, `/<N>/`, `/<N>/<path:filename>`. Catch-all serves `BASE_DIR / "<N>" / filename` if the file exists, else falls back to `BASE_DIR / "<N>" / "index.html"` so React Router can resolve the client-side route.
- Single Cloud Run service (`mizoki-website`) carries every slot via the existing WIF auto-deploy. No LB url-map changes, no per-slot service to monitor, no Node in the runtime Dockerfile.
- The dist/ outputs are **committed directly** — externally built (`npm install && npm run build` with `vite.config.js base: '/<N>/'` and React Router `basename="/<N>"`), then the resulting `dist/` contents land in the flat `<N>/` directory.

**Architecture pivot mid-session:** an earlier attempt this session built per-slot standalone Cloud Run services (`mizoki3-v3`, `mizoki3-v4`) wired by `mizoki-lb` URL maps with prefix-strip rewrites. Tossed for being over-engineered relative to the chosen pattern. The `mizoki3-v3` standalone was retained briefly as backup; `mizoki3-v4` was torn down. By end of day both are deleted — see "Cloud Run cleanup" below.

**Sweep of redundant local files / Cloud Run services:**
- **Deleted folders:** `MIZOKI3-Site (1)/` (orphan Claude React sibling, identical product to the live site), `mizoki-website-all-files/` (13MB stale snapshot of the repo inside the repo — its inner CLAUDE.md only went up to "March 2026"), `legacy_mizoki_site/` (10MB pre-MIZOKI3 backup), `files (19)/` (earlier upload scratch), `Mizoki3_Site_Blog_Meta_ReLU_Deploy_Kit/` (one-time deploy kit).
- **Deleted source zips:** `mizoki3-final-production-pages_chatgpt.zip` (already extracted as `/3/`), `mizoki3-site-deploy_1.zip`, `Mizoki3_Site_Blog_Meta_ReLU_Deploy_Kit.zip`, `files.zip` (timestamp-only churn, content byte-identical to long-since-deployed state).
- **Deleted duplicate HTMLs:** `mizoki3_complete_enterprise_terminal{,(1),(1_gemini)}.html` — three byte-identical copies of the same single-file terminal page, not referenced by the live site.
- **Deleted scratch screenshots:** 17 ChatGPT-generated reference PNGs at the repo root from May 13 / 18 / 19 / 22 (none referenced by served HTML).
- **Deleted misc scratch:** `Claude Final Sitebudget balance sheet` (Pages doc), `MIZOKI Cannonical Lopp.png` (typo'd reference image), `preview.html` (single-file design preview), `01_relu_gate.png` at the repo root (duplicate of `assets/img/relu-article/01_relu_gate.svg`), `README_Captions_AltText.txt`, `LinkedIn_Meta_ReLU_Article.{pages,txt}` (drafts of the now-shipped blog post), `mizoki3-site.textClipping`.
- **Cloud Run cleanup:** deleted `mizoki3-v3` and `mizoki3-v4` standalone services. The flat-dir Flask pattern is the only production serving path now.

**Live route verification (post-cleanup):** `/`, `/1`, `/2`, `/3`, `/4`, `/console`, `/infrastructure/main.tf`, `/blog` — all 200 from `mizoki3.com`.

### Decision OS Homepage + React Sibling Project + Operational Cleanup (2026-05-22)

**Homepage replaced with the "Decision OS" rebuild.** Merged `claude/add-monitoring-dashboard-ENme0` (1 commit, `6c95d5a`) into main. New `index.html`:

- Tailwind via CDN + lucide icons + Inter / JetBrains Mono (no build step — still drop-in to the Flask static server).
- Title: *"MIZOKI3 // The Decision OS for Autonomous Enterprise Cognition"*.
- Hero with animated TCO-KG nervous-system visualizer and live telemetry pill.
- Status Quo vs. MIZOKI3 paradigm comparison.
- Interactive **7-stage SRPVDAL inspector** (Sense → Reason → Plan → Validate → Decide → Act → Learn) with per-stage payload and metrics.
- Decision Control Plane authorization scorecard.
- Tabbed Domain Cells (Counsel / Estate / Capital / Signal / Risk) with deep links to `/counsel`, `/estate`, `/capital`, `/signal`, `/risk`.
- Architecture & Trust governance cards, Operational KPIs grid.
- **Decision Replay** flight-recorder timeline.
- **Interactive Execution Sandbox** terminal with three modes (Liquidity / Compliance / ROAS).
- Five-division grid + Demo CTA. Live Console pill in the nav links to `/console`.

Naming + email conventions preserved: Counsel/Estate/Capital/Signal/Risk; `hello@mizoki3.com`; `/console` deep link.

**React sibling project added: `MIZOKI3-Site (1)/`** (40 files, 468K). Vite + Tailwind + React + lucide. Self-contained — its own `Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`, `cloudbuild.yaml`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `src/components/`, and a parallel `infrastructure/main.tf`. Treated as a **sibling deliverable**, not a replacement for the Flask static site. Awkward folder name (literal "MIZOKI3-Site (1)") is the downloaded-zip artifact — rename if you want; nothing depends on the path.

Also committed: `preview.html` (standalone single-file design preview), 2 ChatGPT reference screenshots from 2026-05-19.

**Operational cleanup performed earlier on 2026-05-22:**

- **Branch cleanup on the `MIZOKICloudRun` repo** (sibling repo in the same org — not this repo): deleted 4 stale branches that were 0-files-different vs main — `claude/mizoki3-homepage-Rp13x`, `copilot/sub-pr-524`, `copilot/sub-pr-559`, `copilot/sub-pr-559-again`. Only `main` remains.
- **Restarted the boss agent** on Cloud Run: rolled `boss-agent-adk` from revision `00218-w9m` → `00219-9zh` via `gcloud run services update boss-agent-adk --update-env-vars RESTARTED_AT=…`. The `RESTARTED_AT` env var is the kick mechanism; it doesn't carry meaning. Use the same trick to roll any other service. Of the five boss-related services (`boss-agent`, `boss-agent-adk`, `boss-agent-backend`, `boss-agent-service`, `boss-rewoo-orchestrator`), `boss-agent-adk` is the most active (rev 218+) and the de-facto primary.

#### Operational lore — gotchas worth remembering

- **Watch for accidental `mizoki3-site/` renames.** On 2026-05-22 the folder was renamed by a Finder drag to `mizoki3-site_claude'/` (trailing apostrophe, looks like a typo). The Flask routes `/console`, `/console/<path>`, and `/infrastructure/main.tf` hard-code the canonical path, so a rename breaks the live site instantly. If you see `mizoki3-site/` "deleted" in git status alongside a similar-looking untracked folder, **don't push the deletion** — diff the file SHAs against `origin/main:mizoki3-site/*` first; if they match, it's a recovery, not a content change. Restore with `mv "mizoki3-site_<whatever>" mizoki3-site`.
- **Google Drive sync makes `git add` on directories with many small files extremely slow** (or hangs entirely — process consumes ~0s of CPU but never returns). If `git add` on a directory like `MIZOKI3-Site (1)/` doesn't finish in a few seconds, kill it (`kill <pid>`), `rm -f .git/index.lock`, and stage the files in smaller batches.
- **Sign In wiring** lives in two places that must stay in sync: `app.py` constants `EXTERNAL_LOGIN_URL` + `EXTERNAL_DASHBOARD_URL`, and `index.html` `<a class="nav-signin" href="/login">`. Both should point at the command-center Cloud Run service. As of 2026-05-19 the canonical command center is `https://miz-oki-command-center-ui-ehqxake3ia-uc.a.run.app`. The legacy `https://mizoki.mizoki3.com` subdomain is dead — don't restore it.

### Sign In Routing (2026-05-19)
- Fixed homepage Sign In: `index.html` `nav-signin` now `href="/login"` (was `href="#contact"`, an in-page anchor that scrolled to the contact section — "the weird spot").
- `app.py` constants `EXTERNAL_LOGIN_URL` and `EXTERNAL_DASHBOARD_URL` updated from the dead `https://mizoki.mizoki3.com` to `https://miz-oki-command-center-ui-ehqxake3ia-uc.a.run.app/{login,dashboard}` — the live command-center UI Cloud Run service.
- The legacy marketing HTMLs (`investor.html`, `industries.html`, `roi.html`, `walkthrough.html`, `resources.html`, `how-it-works.html`, `sales-one-pager.html`, `demo-opener.html`, `pricing.html`, and the `11/` and `legacy_mizoki_site/` mirrors) still hardcode `https://mizoki.mizoki3.com` in their Login buttons. They all 301 to `/` via `legacy_marketing_page()` so users never see them — flag if you want them scrubbed.

### Python Bytecode Hygiene (2026-05-19)
Added `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `*.pyo` to `.gitignore` and removed 7 previously-tracked `.pyc` files (`app.cpython-313.pyc` and friends). Bytecode no longer pollutes `git status`.

### Homepage Rebuild to Five-Division MIZOKI3 Design (2026-05-18)
Full rebuild of `index.html` to match the official MIZOKI3.com mockups:
- Hero: "One Intelligence. Many Domains. Shared Causal Memory." with a NEXUS nervous-system SVG showing example-customer division nodes signaling across the graph. (NOTE 2026-06-02: "brain" metaphor retired — see Positioning & Messaging.)
- MIZOKI3 Flywheel: five-step compounding loop (Signal Enters → Graph Updates → Cross-Domain Impact → Better Decisions → Lasting Memory) with live stats strip.
- SRPVDAL Orchestration: seven-stage iconed loop.
- Decision Control Plane summary panel that deep-links into the standalone `/console`.
- One-System-Many-Lenses bento: COUNSEL, ESTATE, CAPITAL, SIGNAL, RISK — shown as example customer deployments, not a fixed five-part product. Replaces the old per-cell narrative.
- Live Nexus Snapshot: Acme Holdings entity graph + recent-activity feed.
- Governance: Counterfactual Simulation Engine chart + Decision Eligibility Layer score gauge (87 → "Eligible for Autonomous Action").
- Use cases, demo flow, CTA, footer.

Naming consolidation: Legal → **Counsel**, Media Acquisition → **Signal**. The standalone console sidebar was updated to add the Signal lens so the five-division naming is consistent everywhere (homepage, console, Flask routes).

Late-day refinement (2026-05-18, evening):
- New Chapter 06 "Verification & Arbitration" between the Decision Control Plane and Divisions: an animated execution trace of ACT-991 (Capital proposes a $5M distribution, V&A detects the COV-01 covenant breach, DEL scores it ineligible, DCP stamps VETOED, system re-routes to a safe Option B). The decision shown two ways — animated veto trace + the existing static liquidity chart.
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 badge removed from the hero (the company is not certified yet — claiming an in-progress cert on an infrastructure site sold to regulated buyers is a real liability). Replaced with "Customer-Managed Encryption", which is true since the Terraform provisions CMEK.
- Contact email canonical at `hello@mizoki3.com` (a stray `pilot@mizoki3.com` from an alternate draft was rejected).

Added `mizoki3-site/README.md` packaging doc that walks through four deploy options (any static host / GCS / Cloud Run / Firebase) plus Terraform usage.

### `mizoki3-site/` Sub-Tree (2026-05-17)
- `mizoki3-site/console/index.html` — standalone Decision Control Plane (Risk Arbitration Console UI). Sidebar carries Counsel/Estate/Capital/Signal/Risk + Nexus TCKG substrate + Decision Control. SRPVDAL execution trace, TCKG subgraph SVG, decision queue.
- `mizoki3-site/infrastructure/main.tf` — Google Cloud Terraform module for the fiduciary substrate. Matches the actual stack: private VPC, Cloud Spanner with the GoogleSQL property-graph schema for TCKG, Pub/Sub event bus, Cloud Run for SRPVDAL/LangGraph orchestration, Vertex AI Model Garden for Claude reasoning isolation (publisher-model IAM condition pinning), Cloud KMS for encryption.
  - **Outstanding:** the Vertex AI binding pins `claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022`. Bump to the current approved Claude model on Vertex AI Model Garden before any production apply.
  - **Migration note:** an earlier draft of this file used AWS (Bedrock, Neptune, MSK, EKS) — replaced 2026-05-18 because the website and orchestration actually run on Cloud Run, and reasoning runs on Vertex AI, not Bedrock.

### Flask Routes for Console + Infrastructure (2026-05-17)
Added in `app.py` (mirrors the `/blog/` and `/11/` patterns):
- `/console`, `/console/`, `/console/index.html` → serves `mizoki3-site/console/index.html`.
- `/console/<path:filename>` → serves any sub-asset under that directory.
- `/infrastructure/main.tf` → serves the Terraform module as `text/plain`.

Background: the homepage "Launch the Live Console" button pointed at `console/index.html`, but the file lived under `mizoki3-site/console/` with no Flask route, so it 404-ed on the live site. Routes resolved that.

### Branch Cleanup + Dependabot Bump (2026-05-17)
- Cherry-picked dependabot commit `54153c8` into main: Flask `3.0.3 → 3.1.3` in both `requirements.txt` and `mizoki-website-all-files/requirements.txt`.
- Deleted `origin/pre-migration-backup` (held the pre-MIZOKI3 MIZ OKI 3.5 site — kept only as a git-history reference, no longer needed; closed Copilot PR #2 as a side effect).
- Deleted `origin/dependabot/pip/pip-6f6034b2da` after the cherry-pick landed.
- Local safety tag `pre-backup-merge-safety` left in place (points at `f747688`) — not pushed; remove with `git tag -d pre-backup-merge-safety` when no longer wanted.

### Deployment Pipeline Status
- **Auto-deploy on push to `main` works as of 2026-05-18.** Every push triggers `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudrun.yml`, which builds the Docker image with Cloud Build, pushes to `gcr.io/spry-bus-425315-p6/mizoki-website:<sha>`, and rolls out a new Cloud Run revision. End-to-end run time: ~60 seconds.
- Service: `mizoki-website`, region `us-central1`, project `spry-bus-425315-p6`. Custom domain: `mizoki3.com`.
- **Manual fallback:** `./deploy.sh` still works the same way (Cloud Build → GCR → `gcloud run deploy`) when you need to deploy from your laptop without going through git.

#### GitHub Actions auth — Workload Identity Federation
The workflow authenticates via WIF, not a service-account key. No long-lived secrets in GitHub.

GCP setup (one-time, lives in `spry-bus-425315-p6`):
- Workload identity pool: `github-actions` (location `global`)
- OIDC provider: `github`, `issuer-uri=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, `attribute-condition=assertion.repository_owner=='mediaintelligence'`
- Service account: `miz-oki-website-deployer@spry-bus-425315-p6.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - Roles: `run.admin`, `cloudbuild.builds.builder`, `iam.serviceAccountUser`, `storage.admin`, `serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`
- Binding (`roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser`) is `principalSet://…/attribute.repository/mediaintelligence/mizoki-3-5-website` — scoped to this repo only. No other GitHub repo can impersonate the deployer SA.

Repo secrets (set via `gh secret set`):
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` = `spry-bus-425315-p6`
- `WIF_PROVIDER` = `projects/698171499447/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions/providers/github`
- `WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` = `miz-oki-website-deployer@spry-bus-425315-p6.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

To rotate the trust: delete and recreate the WIF provider in GCP, or revoke the principalSet binding on the deployer SA. To extend to another repo: add another `principalSet://…/attribute.repository/<owner>/<repo>` binding on the SA — don't widen the attribute condition.

### Verification Standard for May 2026 Changes
- `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py`
- `python3 -m unittest tests.test_app tests.test_runtime` — 25 passing tests.
- Smoke-test new routes via `app.test_client()` before pushing.

## Previous Work (March 2026)

### Boss Agent & MCP Integration
- Added a concrete Boss Agent runtime with MCP-style tool registration, skill memory, and decision traces in `mizoki_runtime/runtime.py`.
- Exposed discovery and execution endpoints through Flask (`/api/mcp/*`, `/api/boss/*`).
- Added a graph-native decision intelligence layer in `mizoki_runtime/runtime.py` that runs SRPVDAL with GraphRAG retrieval, KG grounding, counterfactual simulation, and subagent recommendations.
- Added direct graph-native APIs at `/api/boss/graph/subagents`, `/api/boss/graph/context`, `/api/boss/graph/simulate`, and `/api/boss/graph/loop`.
- Added loop-to-skill promotion through `skills.learn_from_loop` and `/api/boss/skills/learn-from-loop`.
- Synchronized deployment and control planes across Cells 1-34.
- Handled merging of sub-PRs for pipeline correction and UI optimization.
- Addressed Google Cloud networking by repointing the Global External HTTPS Load Balancer (`mizoki-lb`) to a new Serverless Network Endpoint Group (NEG) hooked to the canonical `mizoki-website` Cloud Run deployment, securing a single source of truth.

### Integration Note
- Prior planning referenced `boss_agent_core.py` and external MCP registration blocks from a different repository shape.
- In this repo, the actual Boss/KG/GraphRAG integration point is the Flask runtime in `mizoki_runtime/runtime.py` plus the API layer in `app.py`.
- Any future graph-native or Boss-agent work should land there unless this repository gains the separate agent-service layout.

### Review-Driven Corrections
- Fixed routing bugs caused by substring matching so `decision control plane` no longer incorrectly maps to the `plan` stage.
- Constrained skill and alias learning inference so the Boss Agent does not accidentally route normal explanation requests into `skills.learn` or `tools.register_alias`.
- Added bounded integer validation for `top_k` and trace limits.
- Hardened trace and alias loading so malformed JSONL or alias records do not break startup or trace inspection.
- Added discovery metadata describing learning tools, tool-learning tools, and routing behaviors so the Boss Agent is more explicit about its capabilities.
- Added loop-aware learning behavior:
  - `skills.learn_from_loop` promotes graph-native loop traces into reusable skills.
  - If a user asks to learn from a loop before any loop exists, the Boss Agent should prefer generating a loop first.

### Why These Changes Were Made
- The initial task history mixed this website repository with a different multi-agent Python service layout.
- The real goal here was not to document graph-native decision intelligence conceptually, but to make the local Boss runtime actually usable, discoverable, and safe.
- The review phase therefore focused on closing the gap between “tools exist"” and “the Boss Agent uses them correctly with the right parameters and the right sequencing.”

### Current Verification Standard
- `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py`
- `python3 -m unittest tests.test_runtime tests.test_app`
- Current regression coverage for this implementation path: 25 passing tests

### Canonical Blog Routing via Flask
Migrated legacy subdomain-dependent blogs to canonical main-domain paths internally using Python/Flask (`app.py`):
- Stripped all meta-refresh `blogs.html` redirections to external domains, pointing them 301 to `/blog/`.
- Configured dynamic, extensionless URL resolving for `relu-lens-meta-algorithm`.
- Added legacy redirect fallbacks for slugs like `meta-relu-gate-go-deep-before-wide`.
- Consolidated article static paths and structure exclusively under `/blog`.
